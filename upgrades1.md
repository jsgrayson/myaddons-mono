Here is the refined feature set for Single-Player Dominance, with "The Hologram" removed.

1\. "The Dojo" (Local Zero-Knowledge AI)

Instead of relying on other players' strategies or "meta" data, your computer teaches itself how to win.

Self-Play Simulations: When your PC is idle, the Desktop Engine runs thousands of battles between two instances of its own AI using your specific pet collection.

Combo Discovery: It finds "broken" team compositions that no human has documented yet by brute-forcing synergy graphs (e.g., discovering that a specific Mechanical pet perfectly counters a specific Beast ability rotation).

Gap Analysis: It identifies specific pets you don't own that would drastically increase your win rate across all trainers, generating a personal "Must Capture" list based purely on combat utility, not popularity.

2\. "The Speed Demon" (Animation Physics)

Optimizing for Time, not just Victory. A 100% win rate is useless if the battle takes 5 minutes due to long animations.

Animation Costing: The engine assigns a "Time Weight" to every ability. It knows that Stampede takes 8 seconds to resolve, while Bite takes 1.5 seconds.

TPS (Time Per Strategy): The Solver prioritizes teams that deal damage in the fewest seconds, even if they take more turns. It avoids multi-hit spells and weather effects (like Sandstorm) that play animations every round unless they are mathematically necessary for the win.

3\. "The Shepherd" (Account-Wide Logistics)

Managing your entire account's roster as a single unit.

The Relay System: The engine tracks which of your alts are parked at which Master Tamers across Azeroth.

Workflow: You press Spacebar. The App tells you "Log into Character A." You win the battle. The App says "Log into Character B."

This eliminates travel time entirely by treating your alts as fast-travel nodes.

Resource Balancing: It tracks Battle-Stones, Bandages, and Pet Charms across all characters, guiding you to the character that needs to spend/trade them most.

4\. "The Architect" (Synergy Graphing)

A local database feature that maps your collection as a network graph.

Combo Mapping: It builds a local graph where Pets are nodes and Abilities are connections.

Example: It automatically links any pet with Black Claw to any pet with Flock or Hunting Party.

Usage: When you catch a new pet, the Architect immediately highlights which other pets in your roster just became more powerful because they now have a perfect partner.

5\. "Ghost Mode" (Humanization)

Safety features for the "One-Button" philosophy to ensure account safety without external data.

Input Entropy: The Desktop Engine randomizes the "Accepted Input Window" by milliseconds. Even if you mash Spacebar rhythmically, the addon executes actions with slight, human-like variances in timing to prevent pattern detection.

Hardware Lock: The system can require a "Dead Man's Switch" (e.g., holding Shift) to operate, ensuring you are physically present and not automating while AFK.
