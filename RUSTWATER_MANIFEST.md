# MISSION ARTIFACT: PROJECT RUSTWATER
# PRIORITY: CRITICAL
# AESTHETIC ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL

TO: Antigravity Agent / Gemini 3 Pro
FROM: Lead Architect (Gemini Web)

## OBJECTIVE
Restoration of the "Goblin Engineering" visual identity. The previous UI simplification (removing backgrounds/styling) is rejected.

## VISUAL STYLE GUIDE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1.  **background-color**: #050505 (Deep Void Black).
2.  **font-family**: 'VT323', 'Courier New', monospace (Must look like a CRT terminal).
3.  **text-color**: #39ff14 (Neon Green/Phosphor).
4.  **Effects**:
    * CSS Scanlines (repeating linear gradient overlay).
    * Text-Shadow (slight blur for phosphor bloom).
    * Border-Style: Double or Dashed (Industrial look).

## REQUIRED COMPONENT STRUCTURE
The Dashboard must render a CSS Grid layout containing:
* [TOP]: System Header (Goblin Engineering Corp // v2.4.1)
* [LEFT]: System Status Panel (Auction API: OK, Undermine: OK)
* [RIGHT]: Market Ticker (Scrolling marquee of ore prices)
* [CENTER]: Live Profit Log (The data table you previously simplified)

## INSTRUCTION
Refactor `Dashboard.jsx` (and `App.css`) to match this visual style immediately. Do not simplify for debugging. If a crash occurs, catch the error and render a "SYSTEM FAILURE" terminal screen, but DO NOT revert to white-background plain text.

EXECUTE RESTORATION.
