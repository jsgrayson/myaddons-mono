# Goblin Mobile UI

This folder is reserved for the future Goblin mobile application.

Recommended stacks:
- SwiftUI (iOS)
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose (Android)
- Flutter (cross-platform)
- React Native (cross-platform)

Mobile UI will eventually serve as a controller for:
- Agent status
- ML predictions
- Task scheduling
- Backend health
- Logs and notifications
