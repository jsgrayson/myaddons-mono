# Goblin Web UI

Skeleton for the Goblin browser dashboard. The static page at `index.html` blocks out:
- System and service overview
- Agent controls and automation queue
- TSM Brain preview and progress bars
- AH scanning board and task list
- Notes panel for wiring API endpoints

## Quick start
1) Open `index.html` directly in your browser (no build tools required).
2) Replace placeholder labels with real data or wire fetch calls to your backend (example endpoint noted in the Notes card).

The page uses Google Fonts (`Space Grotesk` + `Manrope`); if offline, it will fall back to the system sans-serif stack. Style tokens live in the `<style>` block near the top of the file for quick theme tweaks.
