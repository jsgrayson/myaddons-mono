<!-- Simple templates pointing to main apps - copy these to actual project folders later -->
Summary file - All GoblinStack & SkillWeaver templates are in /Users/jgrayson/Documents/holocron/templates/

Templates created:
✅ goblinstack_dashboard.html
✅ goblinstack_server.py  
✅ goblinstack_markets.html
✅ skillweaver_dashboard.html
✅ skillweaver_server.py

These are ready to be moved to their respective project folders when you set up:
- /Users/jgrayson/Documents/GoblinStack/
- /Users/jgrayson/Documents/skillweaver/

The templates use the shared CSS: /Users/jgrayson/Documents/holocron/static/holocron-theme.css

Copy that CSS file to each project's static/ folder for unified theming.
